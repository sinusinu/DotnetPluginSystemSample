# Sample Plugin System in C#

This repository is my personal memo-thing about how to build a simple plugin system in C#.

All the online tutorials I could find were unnecessarily complex for me, so I made this bare minimum, easy to understand sample projects.

The code contains no error checking or whatsoever, so don't quote me.
